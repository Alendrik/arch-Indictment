# Arch-Indictment
**Overall Goals**: Learning more about Linux and Operating Systems by building arch.

## Current Tasking
- Deciding between Gentoo or Arch
- Research Linux kernel and arch fundamentals
	- AUR, Arch Wiki, 
	- sysVinit vs systemd
	- pacman, AUR helpers, wrappers, manual Build Process
- Deciding repo organization
	- Use of .md files
	- How to do branching? (branch per person? branch per concept?)
