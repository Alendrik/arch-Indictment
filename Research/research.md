This is where I will be putting my research findings

# Research Notes and Findings


## Notes on Arch
#### Benefits of Arc
- you can run it on a potato (needs a dual core CPU and 512MB of RAM)
- More simplified than Gentoo
- Runs on a vanilla kernel
- Documentation is not as deep as Gentoo but is more simple
- Seems easier to learn for beginners
#### Drawbacks of Arch
- 

#### Misc Notes
- Even though Arch requires 512MB of RAM, supposedly it will use ALL RAM whenever it can. The idea is that any available RAM is wasted RAM

## Notes on Gentoo
- temp
- can it run on potato?
