# Alendrik Research
## Overview
**Research Goal**: Identify best starting points within arch and lay out a roadmap to follow generally.
- Probably using arch for the sole purpose of saying that we're using it.
- Generate a roadmap

**Guiding Questions**: (These questions are just a rough idea of what I'm trying to get at. Not a template)
- What should I know?
- What do I need?
- Where Do I get it?
- What Dependencies do I need pre-install
- Once installed... what now?
- What are the major considerations to take into account
	- Tile manager/window manager vs Desktop Env.
	- dependencies
	- etc.


## Step 0 - Preparation
### What Should I Know
	What do I need to start? HW reqs? Any concerns over different firmware/HW/middleware/etc? Can I just plug in my USB stick and have the rest work (that's what she said).
	
	Some things worth noting are partition schemes, pacman familiarization, and post-installation processes. There are also plenty of other things within the wiki repository and AUR. 

- **partition schemes**: sometimes, a /home partition is made (and generally recommended).
	- [insert reason]
- **Pacman Familiarization**: Arch's package manager. Important to learn intricacies and relation to AUR. 
	- AUR, [explain intricacies]
- **Post-Installation Processes**: 
	- Setting up the bootloader
	- Installing drivers and other necessary devices

### What Do I Need
