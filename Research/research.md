This is where I will be putting my research findings

# Research Notes and Findings


## Notes on Arch
#### Benefits of Arch
- you can run it on a potato (needs a dual core CPU and 512MB of RAM)
- More simplified than Gentoo
- Runs on a vanilla kernel
- Documentation is not as deep as Gentoo but is more simple
  - Arch Wiki is great place to start
- Seems easier to learn for beginners
#### Drawbacks of Arch
- it's not windows

#### Misc Notes - Arch
- Even though Arch requires 512MB of RAM, it will supposedly use ALL RAM whenever it can? The idea is that any available RAM is wasted RAM

## Notes on Gentoo
#### Benefits of Gentoo
- you can run it on a potato
- Runs on a modified kernel? (when setting up user can make changes?)
- Documentation **very** in-depth and informative. Could be intimidating to new users or hard to understand if you do not have a good grasp of topics
#### Drawbacks of Gentoo
- it's not windows
- you can't say "I use Arch BTW" very big drawback imo

#### Misc Notes - Gentoo
-
