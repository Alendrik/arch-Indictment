# Alendrik Research
## Overview
**Research Goal**: Identify best starting points within arch and lay out a roadmap to follow generally.
- Probably using arch for the sole purpose of saying that we're using it.
- Generate a roadmap

**Guiding Questions**:
- What do I need?
- Where Do I get it?
- What Dependencies do I need pre-install
- Once installed... what now?
- What are the major considerations to take into account
	- Tile manager/window manager vs Desktop Env.
	- dependencies
	- etc.


## Preparation - Step 0
	What do I need to start? HW reqs? Any concerns over different firmware/HW/middleware/etc? Can I just plug in my USB stick and have the rest work (that's what she said).
